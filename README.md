# BBQ-FIRST
The most recent work-in-progress code for BBQ FIRST.

BBQ FIRST is a website used to display data about any FIRST Robotics Competition event. This data gives a partial preview of the strength of any given event by ranking them against each other.

As of right now there are 5 data points that BBQ FIRST shows:
 - BBQ (Blue Banner Quotient)
 - SAUCE (Basically BBQ using all post 2005 blue banners)
 - BRIQUETTE (BBQ only factoring in the last 4 years)
 - RIBS (BBQ only considering the previous years success)
